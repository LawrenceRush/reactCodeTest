# reactCodeTest
Problem addressed - The problem being addressed here is a lack of interesting ui in quiz-based software.

App organization - The app follows a mern pattern, with highschores of users being stored in mongoDB, all routing and paths being handled by express, ui handled by react, and node running the server. The app is split into two files, a server and client. Client requests are handled by the react elements in the client folder, while all backend is handled in the server folder. 

Instructions - Simply hit the start the test button and answer questions accordingly. Then follow prompts after the quiz is done.
